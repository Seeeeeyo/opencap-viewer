Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a Python API that allows users to generate videos of a moving skeleton using .json and .obj files. The API will utilize the OpenCap biomechanics viewer, which is a web-based solution, to render the skeleton and record the video. The API will be designed to be simple and efficient, providing users with a video output based on their input files.

Features
API Endpoint for Video Generation

Accepts .json and .obj files as input.

Returns a video file of the rendered skeleton.

Web-Based Viewer Integration

Integrates the existing OpenCap biomechanics viewer.

Ensures all necessary elements from the viewer are included.

Automated Video Recording

Automatically records the video of the moving skeleton.

Handles the rendering and recording process without user intervention.

Error Handling and Logging

Provides detailed error messages for invalid inputs or failed processes.

Logs all API requests and responses for debugging and monitoring.

Requirements for Each Feature
1. API Endpoint for Video Generation
Input: .json file (skeleton data) and .obj files (3D models).

Output: Video file (e.g., MP4 format).

Endpoint: /generate-video

Method: POST

Request Body:

json
Copy
{
  "json_file": "path/to/skeleton.json",
  "obj_files": ["path/to/model1.obj", "path/to/model2.obj"]
}
Response:

json
Copy
{
  "video_url": "path/to/generated_video.mp4"
}
2. Web-Based Viewer Integration
Integration: Use the existing OpenCap viewer code.

Customization: Ensure the viewer is headless and can be controlled programmatically.

Dependencies: Include all necessary JavaScript libraries and CSS styles.

3. Automated Video Recording
Recording Tool: Use a headless browser (e.g., Puppeteer) to automate the recording process.

Rendering: Ensure the skeleton is rendered correctly based on the input files.

Video Encoding: Use FFmpeg or a similar tool to encode the video.

4. Error Handling and Logging
Error Messages: Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs, missing files, or rendering issues.

Logging: Implement logging for all API requests, responses, and errors.

Monitoring: Set up monitoring to track API usage and performance.

Implementation Steps
Set Up the API Framework

Use Flask or FastAPI to create the API endpoint.

Define the /generate-video endpoint.

Integrate the OpenCap Viewer using the Session.vue file.

Embed the OpenCap viewer in a headless browser environment.

Ensure the viewer can load and render the .json and .obj files.

Automate Video Recording

Use Puppeteer to control the headless browser and record the video.

Save the recorded video to a temporary file.

Handle Errors and Logs

Implement error handling for invalid inputs and rendering issues.

Set up logging to track API usage and errors.

Return the Video File

Once the video is recorded, return the file path or URL in the API response.

Ensure the video file is accessible to the user.
